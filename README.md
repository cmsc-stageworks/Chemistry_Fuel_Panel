# Chemistry Fuel Panel
For our project we’re essentially going to have a removable container that will fit into 3-5 holes in the panel. The removable container will be used to spin inside the holes to determine different “gas levels” of the different elements. There will be some holes in the panel that users can lock the removable cylinder into place.
