# Chemistry Fuel Panel
For our project we’re essentially going to have a removable cannister that will fit into a few holes in the panel. The removable container will be used to spin inside the holes to determine different “gas levels” of the different elements. There will be some holes in the panel that users can lock the removable cylinder into place. There will be a button to confirm gas levels and another button to flush it out. 

On the panel there is an LCD screen for either instructions, a manual, and a periodic table. Depending on how hard we make the difficulty, depends on how complex the chemicals are, differnet variables like a limit on resources, temperature, and pressure to add scalability. 

Potentially add in a gauge for sythesizing fuel for generator and managing power




##  Parts
- 4 hall effect sensors 
- 4 ring lights, 1 per hole in the panel
- LCD screen
- 3 button
